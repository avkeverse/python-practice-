# Python Practice ðŸš€

This repository contains my basic Python practice codes as part of my AI & ML preparation journey.  
I'm currently a CSE (AI-ML) student, learning and building a strong foundation.

I'll be just uploading my small scripts, logic-based programs, and beginner-level projects here as I grow âœ¨

Stay tuned!
