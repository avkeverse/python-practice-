# Python Practice ðŸš€

This repository contains my basic Python practice codes as part of my AI & ML preparation journey.  
I'm currently a 1st-year CSE (AI-ML) student, learning from scratch and building a strong foundation for research internships like METI, OIST, and NIG Japan.

I'll be just uploading my small scripts, logic-based programs, and beginner-level projects here as I grow âœ¨

Stay tuned!
